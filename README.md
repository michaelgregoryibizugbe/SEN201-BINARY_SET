## Task 3: Binary Set Implementation in C++

### Objectives
1. Implement a **Binary Set** structure.
2. Implement **Linear Search** to find elements.
3. Implement **Insertion Sort** (referred to as "Insertious set") to maintain set order.

### Algorithm Descriptions
* **Insertion Sort:** Iterates through the array, taking one element at a time and inserting it into its correct position relative to the already-sorted elements.
* **Linear Search:** A simple sequential search that checks every element in the set until the target is found or the end is reached.

### Flow Chart Logic (Linear Search)
1. **Start**
2. **Input:** Array, Size, and Target Value.
3. **Loop:** From index `i = 0` to `Size - 1`.
4. **Condition:** Does `Array[i] == Target`?
   - **Yes:** Output index `i` and **End**.
   - **No:** Increment `i` and repeat.
5. **End Loop:** If loop finishes without finding target, output "Not Found" and **End**.
